# flappybird
This is the flappy bird game done by Sanat R (codeblaster7) 
I have made this game by using the pygame module in python






Summary of making this game:
  I photoshopped some images
  Then I set some global game variables
  Then we load the images
  then we make the welcome screen
  And then we code the logic of game
    Which you can find in main.py
  Then we check whether our player touched the pipe or ground
  Then we give some random locations for pipe
  And then blit all the images and put all the audio
  And run the game in while loop
